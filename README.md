2D Map Movement
=====================

This is a minimalistic script about functional 2D map movement for text-based adventure games.
Feel free to integrate it into your ASCII game.

Run the file:
```
python main.py
```

Try it out with WASD:
```
.-----.
|...  |
|  .  |
|  .. |
|   . |
|   X |
'-----'
```
